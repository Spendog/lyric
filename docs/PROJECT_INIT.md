# 🚀 Project Initialization Checklist

**Goal**: Start at the "Foundational Peak".

## Phase 1: The Core (Foundation)
- [ ] **Define the Abstract**: What is the "Vision" (e.g., Directional Mining)?
- [ ] **Map to Concrete**: What existing metrics represent this vision (e.g., Hashrate = Velocity)?
- [ ] **Set Hard Constraints**:
    - [ ] UI: Define `max-width` and `max-height` for all containers.
    - [ ] Logic: Define explicit State Machines (Idle, Active, Error).

## Phase 2: The Environment
- [ ] **Zombie Check**: How do we know if the hardware is *actually* dead? (Define "Rest Mode" logic).
- [ ] **Logging**: Implement "Context-Rich" logging (not just "Error", but "Error in State X").

## Phase 3: The Workflow
- [ ] **Copy Templates**:
    - [ ] `GROWTH_KEYS.md` -> `docs/`
    - [ ] `COMMUNICATION_STYLE.md` -> `docs/`
- [ ] **First Task**: Create a `task.md` that breaks down the "Vision" into "Concrete" steps.
